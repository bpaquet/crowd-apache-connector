# config file for 'make test'. You can put lines in this file to have the 
# test attempt operations on a real Crowd SOAP server.
#
# The format is
#
#   <SOAP URL>,<applicationname>,<applicationpassword>,<username>,<userpassword>,[[!]groupname]
#
# For example, the line:
#
#   http://localhost:8095/crowd/services/SecurityServer,apache2,apache2,admin,admin123,crowd-administrators
#
# will test that 
#
#     a) the application 'apache2' can be authenticated at the URL (using password 'apache2')
#     b) The principal 'admin' can be authenticated against the 'apache2' application (using password 'admin123')
#     c) The 'admin' user belongs to the 'crowd-administrators' group. You can also specify '!crowd-administrators' 
#        to test that a user _doesn't belong to the group.
